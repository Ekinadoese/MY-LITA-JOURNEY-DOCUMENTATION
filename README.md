### **OVERVIEW**

This is a documentation of my Ladies in Tech Africa journey in Data Analysis. It covers all hard skills learnt during the Bootcamp.
This began with an Introduction to Data Analysis. Major Data analysis skills taught were 
- Excel 
- SQL and 
- Power BI.

Bonuses include 
- Optimizing LinkedIn account and 
- Building a Portfolio using GitHub

### **DATA SOURCES**

Data was sourced from data sources and warehouse like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/?utm_source=homescreen) and Data.com

### **TOOLS USED**

The below tools were leveraged in the course of this training
- Telegram
- Youtube
- LMS (CANVAS)
- EXCEL
- KAGGLE
- SQL
- GITHUB
- POWER BI
- GOOGLE
- LINKEDIN
- ETC

### **INTRODUCTION TO DATA ANALYSIS**

Data Analysis is the concept of analysing data
Database is a storage where your data is sitted

*FOUNDATION OF DATA*

The journey of data from being a bulk of words and numbers to a vital tool which plays a big role in predicting the future of an organisation is in six stages.
- Data Generation
- Data Structure
- Data Storage
- Data Analysis
- Statistics
- Decision Making

The life cycle of data is as follows
- INJESTION: bring data into tool
- TRANSFORMATION: edit data
- MODELLING: unifying data to speak to each other
- VISUALISATION: turning data into charts and graphs
- ANALYSIS: bringing statistical measures to data sets
- PRESENTATION: presenting your findings

*ETL*

ETL simply means Extraction, Transformation and Loading. It describes everything done to a data from the point of harvest to when it become a useful tool for data analysis

DATA ANALYSIS helps you to know
- What is working
- What is not working
- What to focus on

**WHY DATA ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT**
Data Analysis help us to 
- make informed decision
- understand customer behaviour
- improve operation
- predict future trends
- identify bottlenecks
- better allocate resources
- identify opportunities for innovation
- identify new opportunities

### **SKILLS REQUIRED IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Technical Skills (programming Language like Excel, Python, Power BI, SQL)
- Data Visualisation
- Critical Thinking

### **CAREER PATH IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Business Analyst
- Database Administrator

### **GETTING STARTED IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Education (Degrees and Online Courses)
- Certifications
- Hands-on experience (internship, personal projects, online communities)
  
## **EXCEL**

**EXCEL WORKBOOK**

When you open an excel file, a blank interface called Workbook is seen. This workbook can have several worksheets which is added as desired. At the top of the workbook is the ribbon interface
![Screenshot_20241007-212521](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ad0d04-c935-4d45-af68-bab338c808c7)

Within the RIBBON are TABS and within the TABS are GROUPS and within each GROUPS are ICONS or COMMANDS. Above the RIBBON is the QUICK ACCESS TOOL BAR. There are grid lines accross a worksheet which divides the sheet into ROWS and COLUMNS. The intersection between a row (numbers) and a column (alphabets) is called a CELL. A highlighted cell is called and active cell. Every cell has an address (A1, B6, etc). The address is found in the name box

**EXCEL SHORTCUTS**

- CTRL DOWN to reach last row
- CTRL FORWARD to reach last column
- CTRL SPACE to highlight an entire column
- SHIFT SPACE to highlight entire row
- CTRL Z to undo
- TAB to move from cell to cell or complete a prompt
- ENTER takes you to the next row
- ALT AVV for cell validation
- CTRL - to delete
- CTRL SHIFT + to insert row or column
- ALT TAB swithches between windows
- SHIFT F3 to insert function
- CTRL SHIFT DOWN to highlight entire column
- CTRL A for argument box while function is active
- CTRL 0 to hide highlighted columns
- CTRL E to flash fill
- F4 / Fn F4 for cell referencing
- CTRL PAGE UP worksheet before
- CTRL PAGE DOWN worksheet after
- CTRL D copy down
- CTRL R copy right
- ALT ESV paste as value
- CTRL SHIFT L to filter

**EXCEL FUNCTIONS**

Functions are pre-configured analytical codes used in excel while Formulas are codes created by us to carry out calculations in Excel. Every function begins with an = sign
![basic excel functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd6d2e2-1ca2-4a7e-a1c5-3950c7e36700)

Everything within the bracket in a function is called an argument. Those in squared brackets are optional fields while others are mandatory


  
**DATA ENTRY IN EXCEL**

Everything typed in Excel is treated either as text or number. While texts are aligned to the Left, numbers are aligned to the right. Excel also treats date as numbers using system format. Data can be easily entered using Form. Stay anywhere within the typed data and click on form to display FORM. Cell entry can be validated by defining the kind on information to be filled into it. Select cells to validate, Go to data and click on Validation. To validate text, you must create a list by defining name in the formular bar. We can activate the argument box to ease usage of functions as beginners. When the function is active, press CTRL A to activate argument box

**DATA LOOKUP**

Data lookup is using data set that are handy to get data from other tables that have relationship with the current table. We can find LOOKUP in the formula tab. The functions mostly used include:
- VLOOKUP
- HLOOKUP
- XLOOKUP
- INDEX
- MATCH
- INDEX & MATCH
- CHOOSE
- INDIRECT

**CELL REFERENCING**

Excel treats the cells we are referencing in four ways
- ABSOLUTE REFERENCING ($U$7)
- RELATIVE REFERENCING (U7)
- COLUMN CONSTANT (&U7)
- ROW CONSTANT (U$7)

**IF FUNCTION**

IF Function is used to check conditions and return different values. It is your go to tool used to generate categories by testing certain conditions. If the condition is true, the formula will push the condition

**EXCEL REPORTING**

Pivot table is a data summarization tool. Click any where within your Data Set, go to insert tab, click on pivot table. Then click new worksheet and Okay
