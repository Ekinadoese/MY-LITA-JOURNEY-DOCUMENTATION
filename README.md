### **INTRODUCTION TO DATA ANALYSIS**

Data Analysis is the concept of analysing data
Database is a storage where your data is sitted

*FOUNDATION OF DATA*

The journey of data from being a bulk of words and numbers to a vital tool which plays a big role in predicting the future of an organisation is in six stages.
- Data Generation
- Data Structure
- Data Storage
- Data Analysis
- Statistics
- Decision Making

The life cycle of data is as follows
- INJESTION: bring data into tool
- TRANSFORMATION: edit data
- MODELLING: unifying data to speak to each other
- VISUALISATION: turning data into charts and graphs
- ANALYSIS: bringing statistical measures to data sets
- PRESENTATION: presenting your findings

*ETL*

ETL simply means Extraction, Transformation and Loading. It describes everything done to a data from the point of harvest to when it become a useful tool for data analysis

DATA ANALYSIS helps you to know
- What is working
- What is not working
- What to focus on

**WHY DATA ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT**
Data Analysis help us to 
- make informed decision
- understand customer behaviour
- improve operation
- predict future trends
- identify bottlenecks
- better allocate resources
- identify opportunities for innovation
- identify new opportunities

### **SKILLS REQUIRED IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Technical Skills (programming Language like Excel, Python, Power BI, SQL)
- Data Visualisation
- Critical Thinking

### **CAREER PATH IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Business Analyst
- Database Administrator

### **GETTING STARTED IN DATA ANALYSIS**

- Education (Degrees and Online Courses)
- Certifications
- Hands-on experience (internship, personal projects, online communities)
  
## **EXCEL**

**EXCEL WORKBOOK**

When you open an excel file, a blank interface called Workbook is seen. This workbook can have several worksheets which is added as desired. At the top of the workbook is the ribbon interface
![Screenshot_20241007-212521](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ad0d04-c935-4d45-af68-bab338c808c7)

Within the RIBBON are TABS and within the TABS are GROUPS and within each GROUPS are ICONS or COMMANDS. Above the RIBBON is the QUICK ACCESS TOOL BAR. There are grid lines accross a worksheet which divides the sheet into ROWS and COLUMNS. The intersection between a row (numbers) and a column (alphabets) is called a CELL. A highlighted cell is called and active cell. Every cell has an address (A1, B6, etc). The address is found in the name box

**EXCEL SHORTCUTS**

- CTRL DOWN to reach last row
- CTRL FORWARD to reach last column
- CTRL SPACE to highlight an entire column
- SHIFT SPACE to highlight entire row
- CTRL Z to undo
- TAB to move from cell to cell or complete a prompt
- ENTER takes you to the next row
- ALT AVV for cell validation
- CTRL - to delete
- CTRL SHIFT + to insert row or column
- ALT TAB swithches between windows
- SHIFT F3 to insert function
- CTRL SHIFT DOWN to highlight entire column
- CTRL A for argument box while function is active
- CTRL 0 to hide highlighted columns
- CTRL E to flash fill
- F4 / Fn F4 for cell referencing
- CTRL PAGE UP worksheet before
- CTRL PAGE DOWN worksheet after
- CTRL D copy down
- CTRL R copy right
- ALT ESV paste as value
- CTRL SHIFT L to filter
- ALT F1 to bring up charts
- CTRL SHIFT 1 to insert thousand separators and decimal
- 

**EXCEL FUNCTIONS**

Functions are pre-configured analytical codes used in excel while Formulas are codes created by us to carry out calculations in Excel. Every function begins with an = sign
![basic excel functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd6d2e2-1ca2-4a7e-a1c5-3950c7e36700)

![basic functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e606e6b6-a796-4e09-b412-5ebe73092dc0)

Everything within the bracket in a function is called an argument. Those in squared brackets are optional fields while others are mandatory


  
**DATA ENTRY IN EXCEL**

Everything typed in Excel is treated either as text or number. While texts are aligned to the Left, numbers are aligned to the right. Excel also treats date as numbers using system format. Data can be easily entered using Form. Stay anywhere within the typed data and click on form to display FORM. Cell entry can be validated by defining the kind on information to be filled into it. Select cells to validate, Go to data and click on Validation. To validate text, you must create a list by defining name in the formular bar. We can activate the argument box to ease usage of functions as beginners. When the function is active, press CTRL A to activate argument box

![basic functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b378eae-b2d9-4796-9bf1-d362842595ef)

**DATA CLEANING**

Functions that can be used for cleaning includes
- LOWER
- UPPER
- PROPER
- TRIM
- LEFT
- RIGHT
- MID
- FIND
- LEN
- CONCAT

![NAMES FROM EMAIL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de30f7af-2637-46ed-b65b-e6cb169cf2a4)

![UPDATE SALARY WITH %](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aec6115-599e-45fd-9671-9a8d72583b78)


**DATA LOOKUP**

Data lookup is using data set that are handy to get data from other tables that have relationship with the current table. We can find LOOKUP in the formula tab. The functions mostly used include:
- VLOOKUP
- HLOOKUP
- XLOOKUP
- INDEX
- MATCH
- INDEX & MATCH
- CHOOSE
- INDIRECT

**CELL REFERENCING**

Excel treats the cells we are referencing in four ways
- ABSOLUTE REFERENCING ($U$7)
- RELATIVE REFERENCING (U7)
- COLUMN CONSTANT (&U7)
- ROW CONSTANT (U$7)

**IF FUNCTION**

IF Function is used to check conditions and return different values. It is your go to tool used to generate categories by testing certain conditions. If the condition is true, the formula will push the condition

![IFS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d05b2764-35aa-46bc-b745-93098b2f6ce5)

![IF CONDITION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bedafbb-6264-4249-a174-13a174eb7d68)


**EXCEL REPORTING**

Pivot table is a data summarization tool. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Click any where within your Data Set, go to insert tab, click on pivot table. Then click new worksheet and Ok.
- To create second pivot table, stay on the pivot table, CTRL A to highlight it, CTRL C to copy it. Come to where you want it to be, click and CTRL V to paste. Go to pivot table fields and uncheck data set you do not want. Then, check the dataset you want to analyse
- You can apply filters by clicking on the ROW LABEL drop down
- You can change the statistics to be presented with SUMMARIZE VALUE BY e.g AVERAGE, PERCENTAGE, etc by right clicking on any figure
- You can sort by right clicking any figure and selecting SHOW VALUE AS e.g TOP 10, LAST 5, etc
- To return pivot table to screen, go to PIVOT TABLE ANALYSE, FIELD LIST
- You can duplicate a column by dragging into the bucket
- To switch column position, rearrange in the bucket by dragging to desired position
- To customize figures like 7,000,000,000 to 7Billion, highlight CTRL 1, click custom, add commas to your format. Each comma summarize in 1000. So, we have #,##0,,,"Billion". This does not change the underlying value in the formula
- Column titles can be changed by clicking within the cells and typing in what you want
- To change the design, stay within the pivot table, click on design, pivot table styles
- To convert Date from Year to Month, click on the year and right click, select ungroup, click on any date and right click, select group and choose month
- To add SLICER to chart, select Chart, go to ANALYZE, select insert SLICER. Go to slicer tab, click report collection, check which pivot tables to be affected by slicer

## **SQL**

SQL means STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE it is a DATABASE management app.

After a successful download and installation of SQL and SSMS (SEQUEL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO), you launch the app and open a new query.

## POWER BI 

Power BI (Business Intelligence) is a data visualisation and business intelligence tool that convert data from different data sources to interactive dashboards and BI reports. It is a collection of software services, apps and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insight

**POWER BI DESKTOP** is an interface where all visualization is done

**POWER BI SERVICE** is software as a service SaaS. It is used to publish visualization

**POWER BI Mobile App** is used to access visualization from connected devices on phone

**POWER BI GATEWAY** is for connecting to an on-premise data source without need to move the data. It allows us to query large datasets and benefit from existing investments.

### PRINCIPLES OF DATA VISUALIZATION

- Determine your audience
- Choose the right kind of chart
- Focus on how your audience needs to use the data
- Provide the necessary context for data to be interpreted and acted upon appropriately
- Keep it simple
- Choose colours carefully
- Seek balance in your visual elements including texture, colour, shape, negative space, etc
- Use patterns to identify similar types of information
- Use proportion carefully so that differences in design, size, etc represents differences in value
- Be skeptical. Ask yourself questions

  In summary:
- Strive for clarity and simplicity
- Focus on creating a narrative
- Strike a balance between design and function
